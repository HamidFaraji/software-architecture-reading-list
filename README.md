# Software Architecture Reading & Watching List

Software architecture is the structure of software. Architecture can be planned upfront and/or emerge over time. It includes elements such as services, layers, components, relationships, technologies, standards, principles, conventions and constraints. Architecture can be evaluated based on business objectives in areas such as cost, functionality, reliability, maintainability and operability. In other words, a poor architecture can be costly, unreliable and difficult to maintain, operate, change and extend. The following are common software architecture terms.
